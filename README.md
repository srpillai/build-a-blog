Build-a-Blog

This is a web app that displays blog posts on a main page and allows users to add new blog posts on a form page. After submitting a new blog entry on the form page, the user is redirected to a page that displays only that blog (rather than returning to the form page or to the main page). Each blog post has a title and a body.
